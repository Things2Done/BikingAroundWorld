# BikingAroundWorld

Renamed - My Dream - with lots of hearts.

I was initially able to make the basic webpage as well as get the button emoji posted and turn it in to a functioning button which made the art biker disappear. Then I realized it should not start there and found that I could set it to display:none to make it inivisible to begin with.

I could not figure the scroll function to make the biker image rotate around the earth. I tried a bunch of work arounds which I also could not make work. I asked for help from a few places and ultimately yuqian provided a useful demonstration. I attempted to integrate his solution to that problem into my code. I could not quite make it work. 

So I instead used his code, which was coded as a single file. Broke it up into its HTML, CSS, and Javascript components and then once I had that working rebuilt what I had previously done on top of that. Then formatted and styled the document for aesthetics. Then ultimately changed the functionality of the rotating component slightly to put the biker more directly on the planent. And adusted the speed and size to keep the biker on the screen most (unfortunately not all) of the time, and so that he finished and the bottom most position of the globe. 

Once I did that I then added a spin to the bike button both because I was unsure if it was clearly enough a clickable button wihtout that hover over feature. And because if yuqian helped so much with one of my two animations I wanted a third.
